        <b><font color='blue'>Note:</font></b> At the Danforth Center we refer to our excitation imaging fluorometer (PSII) camera system as 'FLU' internally.
        But others have previously published on their steady-state fluorescence imaging systems (a different type of fluorescence imaging system) and refered to them as FLU.
        We are working to make the naming changes of our functions from 'FLU' to 'PSII', but will not change the naming scheme of the deposited image data.
        Please be aware that these FLU images were captured with a PSII imaging station and not a Steady-State fluoresence imaging station. Cheers! <br>
