## Tutorial: Pipeline Parallelization

**<font color='red'>Warning:</font> Pipelines should be optimized to an image test-set before running a whole data-set.
See Pipeline Tutorial [here](http://plantcv.danforthcenter.org/pages/documentation/function_docs/vis_tutorial.html).
Our image download tool, which talks a LemnaTec database system can be found [here](https://github.com/danforthcenter/PhenoFront).
Our download tool has a specific file structure, which is likely different than yours (just keep this in mind)**

**<font color='red'>Warning:</font> Make sure that debug flag (-D) is not on when running a pipeline over a whole dataset
or your pipeline will slow down in order to print images at every step**
